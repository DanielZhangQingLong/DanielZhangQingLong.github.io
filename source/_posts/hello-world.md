## About Me

I am Daniel, a programmer from China. Most of my work is web development, and my favourite programming language is Ruby. I love Jpop. My favourite band is Ikimonogakari(いきものがかり), their music is amazing! For pure music, I enjoy guitar fingerstyle. I have a guitar which is Yamaha LL16 ARE but I hardly ever play it. I love gaming and I have game consoles like Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4 and Xbox one.


## Why I blog?

### Reason #1: Recall some things
 Actually, I hope my life could be recorded. I want to get out of my comfort zones. I recall my last 5-year work life and I realize that a lot of things disappeared from my memory.  Everyday life is boringa and I am like zombie because it is like the same day.

### Reason #2: Make my life more organized
I ofen make things messy! I often waste plenty of time due to no plans. Also, this happens to my knowledges. I think they are out of order. If I can write down what I have learnt recently, I will keep my knowledges well-organized so that I will have a deeper understanding about them!

### Reason #3: Pratise expressing in English
This is a selfish reason. I have a strong willing to work in another country and spoken English is a must! Now, I can almost understand what native English speakers talk but I cannot express myself in English well. So from beginning I just write very simple and naive english, as time goes by, I will get great progress.

### Reason #4: Employers can learn about me better
In this blog, I will post some tutorials about what I have learnt and my understanding over a period of time. These tutorials can help others, help myself and the employers.


## What in this blog?

This blog is not only focusing on programming technologies, but on some interesting things like games, travel, music and so on. I don't want this blog to be too utilitarian.
